🙏 Special Thanks
This project exists because a certain conglomerate took some like two daily games away from me. So, here is a framework for fun, creative, and community-driven puzzles. So, toss in an idea of two if you have it. Scary? Silly? Yes? I take all of those. Every contributor makes this collection more terrifying and delightful.
