# GitLab Duo MCP Integration Test

## Task: Test PAL MCP Access via GitLab Duo

**Objective:** Determine if GitLab Duo can access PAL MCP tools that Q chat cannot.

**Test Commands:**
```
Use PAL chat with claude-3.5-sonnet: "Design 3 VHS horror puzzle mechanics"
Use PAL consensus with gemini-pro and gpt-4: "Should horror Wordle use 4 or 5 letter words?"
Use PAL clink with gemini planner: "Create VHS horror puzzle implementation roadmap"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Multi-model responses from PAL
- Collaborative AI workflow
- Cross-model consensus building

**GitLab Duo: Execute these PAL commands and report results.**
